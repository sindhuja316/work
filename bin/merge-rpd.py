US-Analytics 
RPD Merge Script

This script allows merges  and diffs of RPD files automatically. The variables at the top of this script must be updated.

The Git repository must include the .gitattributes file with the below body:
*.rpd merge=usa-obiee-merge
*.rpd diff=usa-obiee-diff

Add the below content to the .gitconfig file (use 'git config --global --list --show-origin' to find it):
[merge "usa-obiee"]
        name = US-Analytics RPD merge driver.
        driver = merge-rpd.py merge %O %A %B
[merge "usa-obiee-merge"]
        name = US-Analytics RPD merge driver.
        driver = merge-rpd.py merge %O %A %B
[diff "usa-obiee-diff"]
        name = US-Analytics RPD diff driver.
        command = merge-rpd.py diff
[difftool "usa-obiee-diff"]
        name = US-Analytics RPD diff driver.
        cmd = merge-rpd.py diff

Examples of the above files are included in this repository.
